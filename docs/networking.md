# OpenAudioTools Networking

How OpenAudioTools devices find each other, share audio, and exchange MIDI over a standard Ethernet network.

---

## Design goals

- **One cable** carries audio, MIDI, and control between devices.
- **Zero configuration** — devices appear automatically, no static IPs or manual routing.
- **Open standards only** — no proprietary protocols, no licence fees.
- **Cheap infrastructure** — works with any consumer Ethernet switch or a single direct cable.

---

## Physical layer

Every audio-capable device (MixTee, SynTee, HubTee) runs a Teensy 4.1 with its built-in DP83825I Ethernet PHY — 100 Mbps full-duplex over a standard RJ45 connection. The QNEthernet library provides the TCP/IP stack.

Control-only devices (e.g. a motorized-fader controller) can use a cheaper Teensy with an external SPI Ethernet module (W5500 or ENC28J60). They share the same UDP/IP stack but carry no audio and skip PTP.

The network is IPv4-only, single LAN, no routing. UDP handles all real-time traffic (audio, MIDI, discovery). TCP is reserved for optional configuration UIs.

---

## Addressing and naming

Devices use DHCP when a server is available and fall back to IPv4 link-local (`169.254.x.x`, RFC 3927) when it is not. Either way, every device registers a human-readable hostname via mDNS:

```
model-XXXX.local
```

where `XXXX` is derived from the last four hex digits of the MAC address. Examples:

- `mixtee-01b7.local`
- `syntee-a3f2.local`
- `hubtee-c4e1.local`
- `ctrl-92cc.local`

No manual IP assignment is ever needed.

## Discovery — mDNS and DNS-SD

At boot each device registers its services with DNS-SD so that every other device on the LAN can find it automatically.

### Service types

| Service | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `_jfa-audio._udp.local` | Audio endpoint (RTP stream) |
| `_jfa-midi2._udp.local` | MIDI 2.0 endpoint (UMP over UDP) |

The `_jfa-` prefix is project-specific to avoid collisions with other mDNS services.

### Audio service TXT fields

| Key | Values | Meaning |
|-----|--------|---------|
| `model` | `syntee`, `mixtee`, `hubtee` | What kind of device |
| `dir` | `tx`, `rx`, `txrx` | Stream direction |
| `ch` | `2`, `8`, `16` | Channel count |
| `sr` | `48000` | Sample rate |
| `fmt` | `pcm24` | Sample format |
| `pkt` | `1` | Packet time in ms |
| `stream` | `main`, `aux1`, `busA`, ... | Stream identifier |

### MIDI service TXT fields

| Key | Values | Meaning |
|-----|--------|---------|
| `dir` | `in`, `out`, `inout` | Endpoint direction |
| `ump` | `2.0` | UMP version |
| `model` | `syntee`, `mixtee`, `ctrl`, `hubtee` | Endpoint model |
| `ch` | number | Logical channel count or groups |

### Example service names

```
SynTEE Out 1-2._jfa-audio._udp.local
MixTEE Main._jfa-audio._udp.local
Main Controller._jfa-midi2._udp.local
```

Devices can also browse for peer services to auto-pair — a fader controller discovers the MixTEE's MIDI endpoint and connects without user intervention.

## Clock synchronisation — PTP

Audio devices synchronise their sample clocks with PTP (IEEE 1588v2). Grandmaster election follows the standard **Best Master Clock Algorithm (BMCA)**, so OpenAudioTools devices negotiate cleanly with any PTP-capable device on the same LAN.

Each device type advertises a `priority1` value that expresses its suitability as clock source:

| Priority | Device | Rationale |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| 128 | **MixTEE** | Receives and mixes multiple streams — natural clock anchor |
| 144 | **HubTEE** | Bridges audio and MIDI — good fallback |
| 160 | **SynTEE** | Single-output source — least preferred |

If priorities are equal (e.g. two SynTEEs, or an OAT device and a third-party device at the same priority), BMCA breaks the tie using clock quality and MAC address as defined by IEEE 1588.

- All other audio devices lock to the elected grandmaster as PTP slaves.
- RTP timestamps are derived from the shared PTP clock, keeping all streams sample-aligned.

### Interoperability

- **AES67 / Dante / Ravenna devices** — Because OAT devices use standard BMCA, a third-party AES67 device on the same LAN participates in the same grandmaster election. If it wins (e.g. a dedicated PTP grandmaster clock at `priority1=1`), OAT devices will lock to it. This is by design — one shared clock domain means zero sample-rate conversion between OAT and AES67 streams.
- **Computers / DAWs** — A USB-connected computer does not participate in PTP; the OAT device it is plugged into bridges the clock domain. A computer connected over Ethernet with an AES67 software driver (e.g. Dante Virtual Soundcard, RAVENNA ASIO) is a regular PTP participant and joins the same BMCA election.

The current implementation is software-based, using the Teensy's GPT timer at 1 MHz. This gives ~10-100 us accuracy — well within the 1 ms packet buffer and sufficient for studio use. Nanosecond-grade accuracy (full AES67 compliance) would require a PHY with hardware PTP support such as the DP83640; the DP83825I on the Teensy 4.1 does not have this.

Control-only devices do not participate in PTP.

## Audio transport — RTP

Audio travels as uncompressed RTP over UDP, following a fixed AES67-style profile:

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Sample rate | 48 kHz |
| Bit depth | 24-bit PCM |
| Packet time | 1 ms (48 samples per channel) |
| Channel counts | Fixed per stream: 2, 8, or 16 |

UDP ports are either statically assigned per device (e.g. `50000 + stream index`) or advertised in DNS-SD records.

A receiver subscribes to a stream using the sender's IP, port, and stream ID. On a small studio LAN (fewer than 10 devices) unicast is preferred — it is simpler and avoids IGMP snooping issues on consumer switches. Multicast becomes worthwhile only when multiple receivers need the same stream.

### Bandwidth

16 channels of 48 kHz / 24-bit audio = **18.4 Mbps** uncompressed. The 100 Mbps Ethernet link has ample room for audio, MIDI, mDNS, and PTP simultaneously.

---

## MIDI transport — MIDI 2.0 over UDP

MIDI uses MIDI 2.0 Universal MIDI Packets (UMP) carried over UDP:

- Each MIDI endpoint gets one UDP port.
- The port and endpoint name are advertised via `_jfa-midi2._udp`.
- Session setup is simple: once two endpoints discover each other they handshake and begin exchanging UMP packets.

This runs alongside audio on the same Ethernet cable. CPU cost is under 1%.

## Device roles

Each device type has a defined network personality:

### SynTEE ([SynTee](https://github.com/openaudiotools/syntee))

- Publishes 1–N audio TX streams (main and aux outputs).
- Publishes one MIDI endpoint (`dir=inout`, `model=syntee`).
- Optionally browses for controllers to auto-pair.

### MixTEE ([MixTee](https://github.com/openaudiotools/mixtee))

- Default PTP grandmaster (`priority1=128`).
- Publishes multiple audio streams — both RX (inputs) and TX (buses, mains, auxes).
- Publishes a MIDI endpoint for full mixer control.
- Optionally serves a small web UI at `http://mixtee-XXXX.local/`.

### HubTEE ([HubTee](devices/hubtee.md))

- Subscribes to audio streams from SynTEEs and MixTEEs.
- Publishes its own audio streams if needed.
- Bridges Network MIDI 2.0 to and from DIN/USB MIDI.
- Can run the Patchbay (see below).

### Controller (e.g. motorized-fader surface)

- No audio, no PTP.
- Publishes one MIDI endpoint (`model=ctrl`, `dir=inout`).
- Browses for the MixTEE's MIDI endpoint and pairs automatically.

---

## Patchbay

The patchbay is a lightweight routing manager that runs on the MixTEE or HubTEE:

1. Periodically browses `_jfa-audio._udp` and `_jfa-midi2._udp` services.
2. Builds an in-memory graph of every device, port, and stream from the DNS-SD TXT data.
3. Exposes a simple web UI (HTTP/JSON + minimal HTML/JS) or an OSC/JSON API.
4. Applies routes by opening/closing RTP sockets for audio and initiating MIDI 2.0 sessions between endpoints.

This gives the user a single place to see every device on the network and patch audio and MIDI connections between them.

---

## Security

Version 1 assumes a trusted, isolated studio LAN:

- No authentication or encryption.
- All custom UDP ports live in a documented, non-conflicting range (`50000`–`50100`).
- All custom service types use the `_jfa-` prefix to avoid namespace collisions.

---

## Resource budget (Teensy 4.1)

All network services fit comfortably alongside the existing audio DSP workload:

| Task | CPU |
|------|-----|
| Audio DSP (TDM + mixer) | ~30% |
| RTP encode/decode | 1–3% |
| PTP timestamping | 2–5% |
| mDNS / DNS-SD | < 0.5% |
| MIDI 2.0 over UDP | < 1% |
| QNEthernet stack | 2–3% |
| **Total** | **~40%** |

~60% CPU headroom remains. Memory is similarly comfortable: 8 MB PSRAM total, ~2 MB used for recording buffers, leaving 6 MB for RTP ring buffers, PTP logs, and mDNS cache.

---

## Topology examples

**Direct connection** — A MixTee and a computer connected by a single Ethernet cable. Audio and MIDI flow over that one cable; link-local addressing and mDNS handle everything.

**Star via switch** — Multiple SynTees, a MixTee, and a computer all plugged into a cheap Ethernet switch. Every device discovers every other device automatically. The MixTee wins PTP grandmaster election by priority.

**Star via HubTee** — The HubTee acts as the central hub, connecting SynTees, computers, and MIDI controllers. It bridges USB/DIN MIDI onto the network and can run the patchbay UI for the whole setup.

### Connectivity diagrams
